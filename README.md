# Binary-Search
### This code implements a binary search algorithm to find a given element in a sorted array. The program prompts the user to input an element to search for, initializes an array of integers, and calls the Binarysearch function to search for the element. The Binarysearch function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search range in half and compare the middle element with the target element until the element is found or the range is exhausted. The function returns the index of the element if it is found or -1 if it is not found. The program then prints a message indicating whether the element was found or not. The code includes error handling to exit the program if the element is not found.
